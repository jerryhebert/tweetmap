FEATURES:
[ ] set up twisted consumer as a plugin
[ ] refactor for async management of multiple consumers
[ ] add logging
[x] handle paged requests
[ ] rename repo and docs to be more generic
[x] generalize consumer plugin config loading
[ ] add reliability around consumers
[x] explore geohash_prefix behavior
[ ] add HAL flask plugin
[x] set up nginx mapping so that eventserve can just bind to 127.0.0.1
[ ] run flask through wsgi
[ ] figure out how to clean up the form validation stuff in Flask

BUGS:
[x] use date time of the object being indexed, not the time we created the ES record
[ ] radius+geohash doesn't completely return what I'm expecting for large precision values.
    need to investigate potions for precision field and/or use geo_shape. I don't want to
    reset the index to test this since I have a nice amount of test data currently. would
    need to write a tool for this migration
